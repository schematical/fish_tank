This is the begining of my genetic learning algorithm in Node. I built it at a hackathon for fun but plan to add more to it.

For a quick intro to what I was trying to acomplish check out [This Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvEywP8t12I). 

I started out with tick tack toe instead. There is still a lot to go. Eventually I have an idea for a fully functional game 2d top view simulation game. Connect with me if you have any interest in building a much larger game.

If you want to run it just clone it and run`node cmd.js`. It should generate and battle two or more 'Fish'. Feel free to play with the settings.
